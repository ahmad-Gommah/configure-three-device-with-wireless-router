Packet Tracer is a tool that allows you to simulate real networks. It provides three main menus that allow you to:

add devices and connect them via cables or wireless
select, delete, inspect, label, and group components within your network
manage your network
The network management menu allows you to:

open an existing/sample network
save your current network
modify your user profile or your preferences 


Since Packet Tracer simulates networks and network traffic, the physical aspects of these networks also needs to be simulated. This includes actually finding and deploying physical devices, customizing those devices, and cabling those devices. After the physical deployment and cabling is done, then it is time for configuration of the interfaces used to connect the devices.
